## 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
### **Performance Highlights**  
| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC Score |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Random Forest   |   86%    |    81%    |  80%   |    80%   |    93%    |
| XGBoost         |   85%    |    84%    |  72%   |    78%   |    91%    |

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Pipeline:**  
   The system automatically ingests raw data, validates it, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, testing, and validation sets.

2. **Model Pipeline:**  
   Models are trained using hyperparameter tuning. Once the best model (e.g., Random Forest) is identified, its configuration is saved in a separate JSON file for future runs. Evaluation metrics are computed and stored, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

3. **MLOps & Deployment:**  
   The trained model is deployed via a web application (built using Flask/Streamlit) for real-time predictions. Continuous monitoring, logging, and versioning ensure that the model remains effective over time.
