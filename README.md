## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Pipeline:**  
   The system automatically ingests raw data, validates it, preprocesses it, and splits it into training, testing, and validation sets.

2. **Model Pipeline:**  
   Models are trained using hyperparameter tuning. Once the best model (e.g., Random Forest) is identified, its configuration is saved in a separate JSON file for future runs. Evaluation metrics are computed and stored, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

3. **MLOps & Deployment:**  
   The trained model is deployed via a web application (built using Flask/Streamlit) for real-time predictions. Continuous monitoring, logging, and versioning ensure that the model remains effective over time.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure the Database:**  
   Update `src/configs/mysql_connection.py` with your database credentials.
4. **Run the Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. **Launch the Web Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. **Explore the Notebooks:**  
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to see detailed analysis and visualizations.
