#### **3. Deliverables**
1. **Sentiment Analysis Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the overall sentiment of customer feedback on hotel bookings and cancellations,
including key themes and recurring issues.
2. **Predictive Model**: Implementation and deployment of a machine learning model to forecast cancellation rates and identify high-risk bookings.
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: A detailed list of strategies to reduce cancellations, improve guest experience, and optimize resource allocation.

#### **5. Methodology**
The analysis will follow these steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Model Training**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., NLP tools) to train models on the provided dataset.
3. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Identifying trends, patterns, and sentiment shifts across different booking periods and room types.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Establishing criteria to measure the effectiveness of recommendations based on cancellation rate reductions and guest
satisfaction improvements.

#### **6. Timeline**
- **Week 1-2**: Data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **Week 3-4**: Sentiment analysis and identification of key themes.
- **Week 5**: Compilation of report and actionable recommendations.
- **Week 6**: Final review and adjustments before delivery.

---

#### **7. Expected Outcomes**
1. Enhanced customer satisfaction by addressing recurring feedback points.
2. Increased retention rates through targeted product improvements and service enhancements.
3. Improved operational efficiency via data-driven decision-making processes.

---

#### **8. Challenges and Safeguards**
- **Challenge**: Data quality variability across platforms (e.g., direct bookings vs. third-party platforms).
  - **Safeguard**: Utilize robust preprocessing techniques to ensure data consistency.
- **Challenge**: Interpretation of nuanced feedback.
  - **Safeguard**: Conduct thorough reviews by cross-functional teams before implementation.
